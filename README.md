## About Me

Born and raised in Spain, I love travelling and inter-cultural experiences. I also love software-development. I love the figuring out how things work, designing, creating and collaborating with other individuals to build something amazing! Movie nerd, science fanatic, but above all, a weeb.

I'm a fun-loving individual, but can focus on my work like flipping a switch.
